This page contains a link to a table with the ranking and performance of all ranked RoBERTa-base models. In addition, it 
contains a table with the baseline and the 10 best models.
The original ranking was done by finetune only the classification head of the model (linear probing) over the 
MNLI dataset.  The best models 
by this ranking where ranked by the average accuracy after finetuning over the 36 datasets (except for the stsb dataset, 
where we used the Spearman correlation instead of accuracy).

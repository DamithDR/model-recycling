This page contains ranking of finetuned models, base on RoBERTa base architecture. The ranking was done by comparing the
results of fintune only the classification head of the model (linear probing) over the MNLI dataset. The best models by
this ranking ranked by the average accuracy after finetuning over the 36 datasets (except for the stsb dataset, where we
 used the Spearman correlation instead of accuracy).
